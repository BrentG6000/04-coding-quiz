# 04-coding-quiz

## Description

This web app is designed to be an example quiz that beginning web developers can take to test their knowledge about JavaScript. I built this app to test my ablity to use vanilla JavaScript.
This app can be used by other developers to make quizzes for themselves since it is very easy to add additional questions. While building this app I learned how to use querySelect and createElement to manipulate html using JavaScript and how to store strings in the browser's local storage.


## Usage

To use this app, simply launch the web page from a browser either locally using this code or from this address: https://github.com/BrentG6000/04-coding-quiz/tree/master.
Click the start button to begin the quiz and click one of the answer buttons given for each question. You will be given your score at the end of the quiz and
will have the option to store your score in the browser.
